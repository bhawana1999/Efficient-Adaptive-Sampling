Bathymetry Image to Depth

The depth data from the bathymetry image is stored as pixel wise data in the corresponding .csv file. The first two columns are Height and width respectively and the rest of the values are the depth value.

The value 0 in the depth data is the area in the bathymetry data which is void.

If you want to convert a similar bathymetry image to the depth data , edit the image importing line in the code to the image path and the maximum depth of the lake.
